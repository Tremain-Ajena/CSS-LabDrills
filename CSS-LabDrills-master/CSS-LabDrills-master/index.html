                <h2>Channel Zero</h2>
                <p>In the anthology Channel Zero, horror and creepy pasta based story lines are pushed to the forefront and are a delightful way to reinvigorate the horror genre that has become more or less a <span class="isolation">redistribution</span> of the same tropes and stories.</p>

                <h2>Candyman</h2>
                <p>Candyman is a movie that does not really need an introduction. The movie centers around the mythical figure Candyman, played by Tony Todd, and how he thrives off of the rumors that the people of his <span class="isolation">"congregation"</span> whisper about him. He presents himself more within our world as his existence is threatened by a doctoral thesis candidate named Helen who seeks to explore how myths are created by the oppressed as a form of escapism. This movie is a truly interesting tale with a lot to analyze and digest.</p>
